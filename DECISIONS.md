# Decisions — astro-code

> Append-only ADR-lite log. Each entry: what we decided, why, and what we rejected.
> Add entries with `ac decision add "<title>" --why "…" --rejected "…"` or
> `/astro-decision`. Agents read this so past decisions are respected, not relitigated.

**Why:** Claude Code 4.8 runs the framework directly; no build/transpile/bundler and node: builtins only keeps it lean, auditable, and instantly runnable

**Rejected:** TypeScript + build step; runtime deps for CLI/arg parsing
