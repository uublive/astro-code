# Decisions — astro-code

> Append-only ADR-lite log. Each entry: what we decided, why, and what we rejected.
> Add entries with `ac decision add "<title>" --why "…" --rejected "…"` or
> `/astro-decision`. Agents read this so past decisions are respected, not relitigated.

## ADR-001 — Dependency-free ESM-only Node ≥22 substrate
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** Claude Code 4.8 runs the framework directly; no build/transpile/bundler and node: builtins only keeps it lean, auditable, and instantly runnable

**Rejected:** TypeScript + build step; runtime deps for CLI/arg parsing

## ADR-002 — Orphan-branch git compare-and-swap for all shared state
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** lib/shared.mjs transact() makes numbering, decisions, and canon collision-proof across developers using a non-force push whose rejection is the mutual exclusion — no server, no gh, works on any remote

**Rejected:** server-side coordination; local-only numbering; gh API

## ADR-003 — Project-global phase numbering (never restart per milestone)
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** registry claims allocate max+1 across the whole project to prevent the milestone-1-twice counter-reset drift

**Rejected:** per-milestone phase counters

## ADR-004 — Plain-file state owned by the CLI; ROADMAP.md generated
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** all .astrocode JSON is mutated only through lock-guarded lib helpers; the human-readable roadmap is rendered, never the source of truth

## ADR-005 — Workflow-tool execution: dependency waves + worktree isolation + sole integrator
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** parallel executors run in isolated worktrees; the integrator is the only git actor (Workflow scripts can't run git) and folds waves onto the branch; same-file tasks are never co-scheduled

**Rejected:** parallel agents committing to one working tree (caused integration collisions)

## ADR-006 — Two-gate phase closure: AI verifies, only humans accept
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** the AI verifier reaches verified at best; ac phase accept refuses unless verified, so a human UAT gate is required to reach complete

**Rejected:** AI auto-closing phases

## ADR-007 — GitFlow mapping: milestone = feature branch (Option A)
_2026-06-05_

**Why:** User-chosen model: each milestone is one feature/m<N> branch off develop, phases commit on it, milestone complete = PR to develop. Simplest and matches the original proposal

**Rejected:** Option B (phase = feature, milestone = release/<N>); long-lived milestone branches must be kept small to avoid develop drift
